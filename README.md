# ml-website-phishing

In this capstone project, we will analyze a dataset and train that data with different machine-learning algorithms to test how effective it will be. We are testing whether or not a given website is considered "website phishing". After doing an analysis of the dataset, we will build a program that will take in a user input URL and determine if it is considered phishing.
