# ml-website-phishing

In this capstone project, we will analyze a dataset and train that data with different machine-learning algorithms to test how effective it will be. We are testing whether or not a given website is considered "website phishing". After doing an analysis of the dataset, we will build a program that will take in a user input URL and determine if it is considered phishing.

Directions: Download the data file, and the notebook and you should be able to run the program. It is okay if computing takes a long time since there is so much data.

Future Ideas:
Application that takes in URL's rather than using the notebook
Add different ML models
Use a higher amount of the dataset rather than just 25%
